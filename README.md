# COVID-19-PyTorch-Image-Classifier
Used a ResNet-18 model and trained it on a COVID-19 Radiography Dataset. This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19. The objective of this project was to create an image classification model that would predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with reasonably high accuracy.
